# Guess a Number 
Very simple game, didn't take much thinking power at all. Computer will generate a random number between 0 and X. The larger number is determined by which level you pick. Of course you can exit the game from the menu by typing 0. However there is no way to exit the game in the middle of a round. I may or may not add that if I feel like it, it wouldn't be hard.

## Things to Add when Bored 
- A way to exit the game while in a round
- Be able to play a certain amount of rounds in a row without having to rerun the file
